The purpose of this project is to develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting the fuel efficiency 
(miles per gallon, MPG) of automobiles based on various features, including engine displacement, horsepower, weight,
and acceleration. Accurate MPG predictions are critical for automotive manufacturers, policymakers, and consumers 
to optimize fuel consumption and reduce environmental impact.

This project focuses not only on achieving high prediction accuracy but also on comparing the performance of multiple
regression techniques, including linear regression, decision tree regression, support vector regression, and ensemble
methods. The objective is to identify the most effective regression model in terms of accuracy, computational 
efficiency, and robustness to different data scenarios. Insights gained will inform future model selection for similar
predictive tasks.
